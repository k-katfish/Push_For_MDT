So... you don't actually compile a Powershell Script. However! You can use ps2exe to make a powershell script into an executable application.

Note - you need to have ps2exe installed first. Open powershell as administrator and run the following:
PS > Install-Module PS2EXE
(say yes/Y to any prompts)


You can then run it manually, or just have the 'compiler' do it for you. To do it automatically just double click Compile.exe in the Push_2.0 directory.
to run this manually open Powershell and run:
PS> ps2exe .\"PUSH_2.0.ps1" 
which will automatically create the executable "PUSH_2.0.exe"
