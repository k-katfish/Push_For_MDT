How do I add a group of computers to PUSH?

PUSH gets its groups from the name of every file in the Groups folder. To add a group to PUSH, create new plaintext file in PUSH_2.0\Groups\.

The name of the file (minus the .txt extention) will appear in the dropdown menu.

In the file, place the names of all of the computers you want in that group, each on a new line.

For example: the file Servers.txt appears in the dropdown menu as "Servers".
Servers.txt:
Server-01
Server-02
Server-03

PUSH will read that file to grab the names of all of the computers and fill those into the list of computers you can work on.

In the Servers.txt example above, the available servers for PUSH will be Server-01, Server-02, and Server-03.

!Note! 
You shouldn't need to add the domain to the end of the computer names, PUSH should find them just fine as long as you're running it on a domain computer.
