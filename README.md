Push Updates and Software to Hosts

This is a tool I wrote to be a GUI for running scripts on a remote computer. And when you can run a script you can do just about anything.

## Software
You'll need to write your own software installer scripts. Search the internet if you have to. I'll try to provide some samples.

## Groups
The whole point is that you can manage a whole lot of computers at once. With the Groups folder you can create a text document and place the names of the computers in that group in the text document. For example:

Lab_401.txt
L401-01
L401-02
L401-03

You can select all of these computers at once, and with one click install a piece of software on all of these computers, no extra work required.
